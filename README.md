# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Tweeter allows for the user to post their thoughts, feelings or anything they want in 140 characters or less. Tweets are posted with time stamps with the newest tweets posting at the top. 

Tweeter exemplifies the use of HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end, while Node and Express are used for the back-end.
